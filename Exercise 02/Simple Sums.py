"""In this exercise, you will create and work with integer variables, perform arith-
metic operations, and print the result to the console.

Steps:
1. Declare a variable and initialize it with the integer value 8.
2. Declare a second variable and initialize it with the integer value 10.
3. Declare a third variable that stores the sum of first two numbers.
4. Print the value of the sum to the console."""

#Ansers:
#Step:1. Declaring a variable and initializing it with the integer value 8.
No1= 8

#step:2. Declaring a second variable and initializing it with the integer value 10.
No2= 10

#step:3. Declaring a third variable which will be storing the sum of two numbers.
Total_number = No1 + No2 

#step:4. print the value of the sum to the console.
print("The total sum is:",Total_number)
